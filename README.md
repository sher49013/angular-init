# Angular Init
use this angular boilerplate to start your new project. Use this to save time. No need to add request, response interceptor, access guard, and not found component route feature. I added auth login system in this angular init project.

Simple clone and start work on core requirements.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.9.

## Development server
Run npm i for install packages

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
